# Project State

Last updated: 2026-05-24

## Current Decision

`TASK-SOURCE-PLATFORM-001` is accepted.

Accepted boundary:

```text
official-sources = upstream official-source ingestion and evidence platform
downstream projects = staging + review + product decisions
```

The operative map is:

```text
docs/CROSS_PROJECT_INTEGRATION_MAP.md
```

The supporting report is:

```text
docs/reports/CROSS_PROJECT_INTEGRATION_MAP_2026-05-24.md
```

## Active Boundary

`official-sources` remains the common upstream platform for official source ingestion, evidence,
citations, integrity metadata, scoped artifact availability, candidate/evidence review records,
downstream-ready evidence exports, and alert-grade dry-run/export feeds.

It must not become a downstream product backend.

Hard guardrails:

- No new `oposiciones2.0` write actions from `official-sources`.
- No alert-grade to `source_candidates` conversion.
- No product records created by `official-sources`.
- No notifications, subscriptions, ranking, publication, or product workflow ownership in
  `official-sources`.
- Next allowed platform work must be one source operation at a time.
- Product-local design or preview work must happen inside the downstream repo, not in
  `official-sources`.

## Accepted Task Log

| Task | Status | Decision artifact | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `TASK-SOURCE-PLATFORM-001` | Accepted | `docs/CROSS_PROJECT_INTEGRATION_MAP.md` | Locks `official-sources` as an upstream official-source ingestion/evidence platform and keeps downstream product decisions out of the platform. |

## Next Allowed Work

Allowed next work:

1. One explicit source operation at a time in `official-sources`.
2. Product-local design/preview for draft process creation in `oposiciones2.0`.
3. Evidence-grade staging work in `EduAyudas` or `la-ayuda` only after their local states are clean.
4. A source-needs audit for `renta-verificable` before any integration.

Not allowed from this repo:

- downstream writes;
- DB/VPS operations without a separate source-specific task;
- broad imports or backfills;
- alert storage implementation before product storage is approved;
- `oposiciones2.0` product record creation.
